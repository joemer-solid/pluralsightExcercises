SRP – Project Sample Overview 
- please open the file: Overview_Start.html once the project has been cloned.
To open from Visual Studio:
1.	Right click on the file Overview_Start.html from Solution Explorer
2.	Select the "Open With" option
3.	Search for a browser application in the dialog box like "Google Chrome" and click the OK button
4.	The file will now open in the browser

    	This sample represents a new project that is NOT currently adhering to Single Responsiblity Principle

	Points of Focus for this exercise:

•	SOLID means SUPPLE CODE
•	Classes that adhere to Single Reponsibility Principle have a SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY - more specifically: A SINGLE  REASON TO CHANGE
•	Since all of the 5 SOLID principles interact synergistically, this exercise will NOT be representative of a real-world code refactor

1.	To begin the exercise, determine how many reasons the SRPFileStore_Start class has to change.
2.	Once this is done, refactor the code in the namespace: ‘Finish’ using the information below as a guide. 
Start with the information under the sub heading Points of Consideration.
Also: a “before” and “after” UML Class diagram is included to assist with the exercise. (SRP_Start_Finish.jpg in the “Finish” folder)
3.	In the Test folder, create a test class and tests that exercise the refactored code named: SRPFileStore_Finish_Tests.cs or something similar.
